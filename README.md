# About
I love being an interactive student when it comes to taking courses, so while I was taking the algorithms and data structures course, I coded and toke a ton of 
notes on the topic. 

The course was coded in Javascript, but I wanted to code in C++ to make use of pointers and some of low level features, so during the course I watched the 
lecture and understood the topic well, then researched (if needed) and then implemented it on my own using C++.
